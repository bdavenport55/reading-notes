### What is wireframing?

Design process for planning the layout of a website, app, or product.  Emphasis on what the site will look like to end-users and how they will interact with it.  It is a very rough sketch, free of colors, typeface choices, etc., so that the overall interactiveness of the site can be understood.

## HTML Basics

<br>

<br>

Provides the **structure** of a webpage

<br>

## 4 main components of an HTML element

* The opening tag
* The closing tag

## Semantics

<br>

> In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code â€” for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".) *From: (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics)*

<br>

In JavaScript, semantics can help discerning what two different functions do.

<br>

In CSS, semantics can help identify which style types are being used. 

<br>

In HTML, semantics are quite a bit more important. Some of the benefits of writing semantic markup include: <br>

* Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (SEO)
* Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page
* Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes
* Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated
* Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming  
    *From: (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics)*

HTML semantics tags include:

* `<article>`
* `<aside>`
* `<details>`
* `<figcaption>`
* `<figure>`
* `<footer>`
* `<header>`
* `<main>`
* `<mark>`
* `<nav>`
* `<section>`
* `<strong>`
* `<summary>`
* `<time>`
