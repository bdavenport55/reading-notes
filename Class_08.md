## Loops

### **For-loop**:

 does *something* to each thing in a list, does *something* 10 times, 12 times, 34566 times, etc.
*  Example: write name 10 times

```javascript

for (let i = 0; i = 1; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

```
`for` starts the loop

`(let i = 0;` is the starting point of the loop

`i = 1;` defines how many iterations the loop will make (how many times it will go)

`i++)` describes the interval the loop will increase each iteration (go up by 1, go up by 2, etc.)

### **While-loop**: does something as long as some condition is true
* Example: while there are forks still in the dishwasher, put them in the silverware drawer
