## *Growth Mindset*
<br>
I believe that a having a growth mindset means believing that regardless of skill level, experience, or expertise, one can improve upon something;  a starting point can be defined and you believe that you can progress from that starting point to a point of greater status than that starting point. Simply, you can grow.

> A growth mindset believes that oneâ€™s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning. (Steve Haffenden, 2015, atlassian.com)

Here are a few ways I remind myself to stay in a growth mindest:
* Challenge is not meant to deter me from doing or trying something, challenge is an opportunity to learn and become better at doing something.
* Effort is not fruitless, yet it is necessary.  The pains of today will produce the results of tomorrow.
* Criticism is a way of seeing my products and results through the eyes of others.  I will not catch everything that needs to be caugth in order to perfect what I produce, and thus criticism helps me to see what I cannot see.
