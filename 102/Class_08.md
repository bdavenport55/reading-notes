* [__Comparison Operators__](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#comparison_operators)

* [__Arithmetic Operators__](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#arithmetic_operators)

* [__Bitwise Operators__](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#bitwise_operators)

## Loops

### __For-loop__:

 does *something* to each thing in a list, does *something* 10 times, 12 times, 34566 times, etc.

* Example: write name 10 times

```javascript

for (let i = 0; i = 1; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

```

`for` starts the loop

`(let i = 0;` is the starting point of the loop

`i = 1;` defines how many iterations the loop will make (how many times it will go)

`i++)` describes the interval the loop will increase each iteration (go up by 1, go up by 2, etc.)

### __While-loop__: does something as long as some condition is true

* Example: while there are forks still in the dishwasher, put them in the silverware drawer
