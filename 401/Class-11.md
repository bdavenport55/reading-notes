## Event Driven Applications

### Event Driven Programming<sup>1</sup>

#### 1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

`EventEmitter`

#### 2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

Instead of having a function that does something and a separate function that finds out if the first function has fired, the first function can contain code inside of it that will communicate that it has fired, reducing a step in the overall code.

#### 3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

If you wanted to know what the day's news is, it would be so inconvenient for you to drive to the news station and ask a reporter what the news is for the day.  Instead, towers broadcast a TV signal and if you want, you can just turn on your TV and now the news is being broadcast to you.  If you don't feel like hearing the news, you can just refrain from turning your TV on.
