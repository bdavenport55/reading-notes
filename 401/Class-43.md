## OSS Contributions

There are lots of resources for contributing to open-source projects.  Contributing to open source projects can bolster your portfolio and experience, help you grow your skills, and make an impact wherever the software is used.  One organization, Call for Code, uses open source software to solve social and humanitarian issues.
