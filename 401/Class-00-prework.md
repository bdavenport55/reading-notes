## SQL Databases

### SQL Practice<sup>1</sup>

SQL databases seem a lot more flexible and easy to work with than NoSQLs.  You can narrow down search results to certain columns and rows, you can add and delete data, and you can add whole new tables or completely remove tables.

## Software engineering<sup>2</sup> <sup>3</sup> <sup>4</sup> <sup>5</sup> <sup>6</sup>

### What's the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

I have a restless brain, and I hate seeing inefficiency being tolerated and compounded.  My restless brain looks at inefficiencies and first tries to identify what is causing the ineffeciency, and second, how to solve or improve on the inefficiency.

### What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

* Quit staring it, not actually doing anything, expecting the answer to just appear
* Say out loud the steps/processes leading up to the sticking point, to ensure I truly know how the code is working up to that point and what the next logical step would be
* Take a break, walk away from it completely or work on something else for a little bit

## Practice in the Terminal<sup>7</sup>

### The Command Line - What is it, how does it work and how do I get to one.

A command line is a text-based interface to the system where commands can be typed in to execute functions.  On a Mac, you can open a terminal by finding it under Applications -> Utilities.  On Windows, you will need to install an SSH client.

### Basic Navigation - An introduction to the Linux directory system and how to get around it.

`pwd` - Print Working Directory - a command that will print the current working directory

`ls` - prints content of current working directory

`cd` - move to a different directory

Relative path - a file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.

Absolute path - A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.

### More About Files - Find out some interesting characteristics of files and directories in a Linux environment.

* Everthing is a file - files, folders, your keyboard, your monitor
* Linux looks in files to determine what they are - ignores file extensions
* Linux is case-sensitive
* Spaces in file names can be used - either wrap the whole name in quotes or use escape characters
* Use a full-stop (period) at the beginning of file names for hidden files

### Manual Pages - Learn how to make the most of the Linux commands you are learning.

* typing `man` followed by the command you want to look up will print a 'manual', or info synopsis, of the command

* typing `man -k` will do a keyword search in the manuals

* long hand commands (`--`), short hand commands (`-`) - can invoke several options at once

### File Manipulation - How to make, remove, rename, copy and move files and directories.

`mkdir` - make a directory(folder)
`rmdir` - remove a directory
`touch` - create a blank file
`cp<source><destination>` - copy a file
`mv<source><destination>` - move a file
`mv<source><same_directory>` - results in a renamed file
`rm<file>` - remove a file
`rm -r -i` - remove recursively and interactively
