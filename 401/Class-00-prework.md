## SQL Databases

### SQL Practice<sup>1</sup>

SQL databases seem a lot more flexible and easy to work with than NoSQLs.  You can narrow down search results to certain columns and rows, you can add and delete data, and you can add whole new tables or completely remove tables.

### What's the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

I have a restless brain, and I hate seeing inefficiency being tolerated and compounded.  My restless brain looks at inefficiencies and first tries to identify what is causing the ineffeciency, and second, how to solve or improve on the inefficiency.

### What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

* Quit staring it, not actually doing anything, expecting the answer to just appear
* Say out loud the steps/processes leading up to the sticking point, to ensure I truly know how the code is working up to that point and what the next logical step would be
* Take a break, walk away from it completely or work on something else for a little bit
