## Ethics in Tech

### Reflection on 'The code I'm still ashamed of'<sup>1</sup>

This article was about the author's experience writing code for a pharmaceutical website that essentially funneled users to use a certain prescription drug the company was trying to market with the website.  The author explains how he was given instructions to write code for a quiz on the website, the answers to which essentially only urged the user to use the drug unless in cases of having an allergy to the drug.  The author saw a news report of a young girl who died after taking the drug.  The main point is that we can do amazing things with code, much of which is opaque to the users of the code, and using it to coerce users into doing something, particularly as consequential as taking a prescritption drug that could worsen depression and feelings of suicide, is extremely unethical.  While there is a certain level of marketing in much of the code that we will write, it is important to know where the line is between marketing and manipulation.

### Reflection on 'Big data is our generation's civil rights issue, and we don't know it'<sup>2</sup>

It used to be inefficient and burdensome to collect data, so any data that was collected was done for a specified purpose, defined before the collection of the data.  With advances in technology, collecting data is now so easy, there is an abundance of it and it is being collected just for the sake of collecting it, and later, it can be sifted and used for particular reasons.  The problem with this is that nefarious reasons for using data (i.e. redlining) and can be veiled with misleading language.  So companies can decide they want to do some nefarious thing, look at the data they have, then make decisions based off of it that hurt a particular group of people, but the companies can easily cover themselves by saying the use of the data was for a different reason.  Defining a purpose for collecting data before the collection would shed light on any nefarious intent.
