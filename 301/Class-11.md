|SQL | NoSQL|
|----|------|
|Primarily called Relational Databases (RDBMS)|Called as non-relational or distributed database|
|Table-based databases|Document-based, key-value pairs, graph databases; wide-column stores|
|Predefined schema|Dynamic schema for unstructured data|
|Vertically scalable|Horizontally scalable|
|Use SQL (structured query language) for defining and manipulating data|Queries focused on collection of documents, sometimes called UnQl (Unstructured Query Language)|

### 2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

  Complex queries

### 3. Give a real world example.

  MySQL

### 4. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

  Hierarchical data storage, large data sets

### 5. Give a real world example.

  Hbase

### 6. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

  NoSQL

### 7. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

  No as scalable as SQL

## SQL vs NoSQL or MySQL vs MongoDB<sup>2</sup>

### 1. What does SQL stand for?

  Structure Query Language

### 2. What is a relational database?

### 4. What is a ‘schema’?

  The format of information being put in a table - Headings of ID, name, price, info, etc

### 5. What is a NoSQL database?

### 6. How does it work?

  Not tables, but "collections" with documents, doesn't need same schema

### 7. What is inside of a Mongo database?

  Collections of documents

### 8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
