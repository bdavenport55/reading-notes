### 2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

* Learning from fellow students - when you're driving for somebody, you see new ways of writing and new tips and tricks

### 3. How does pair programming work?

Commonly, a navigator watches the driver sitting at the computer. The driver does the physical work - navigating files, directories, and editors and actually writing the code.  The navigator is thinking about the big picture and providing the driver with direction on what to write, but does not write and code themselves. Navigators might be on their computer as well researching solutions and documentation
