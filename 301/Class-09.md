## Functional Programming Concepts<sup>1</sup>

### 1. What is functional programming?

  A style of coding that 'treats the computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data'

### 2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

  A function that returns the same result if given the same arguments (deterministic) and does not cause any observable side effects

### 3. What are the benefits of a pure function?

  Easier to test

### 4. What is immutability?

  Unchanging or unable to be changed

### 5. What is Referential transparency?

  A function consistently yields the same result for the same input

## Node JS Tutorial<sup>2</sup>

### 1. What is a module?
