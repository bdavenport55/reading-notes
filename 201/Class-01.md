# Introductory HTML and JavaScript

## **HTML**

### HTML Structure

Describes the structure of pages - where things go

Made up of elements straddled by tags

`<main></main>`

Tags act like containers and tell you what is in between them

Attributes: name-value pairs that tell more about an element 

`<p lang-"en-us">Paragraph in English</p>`

### Extra Markup

Different, evolving versions of HTML <br>
HTML5 released in 2000

Comments: notes in HTML code that cannot be seen on webpages, used to notify developers looking at the code of something important.  Written as such:
`<!--your comment here-->`

ID element: uniquely identifies elements from other elements on the page

`<div>` and `<span>` elements are used to group block-level and inline elements together

`<iframes>` cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed

The `<meta>` tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page

Escape characters: some characters are reserved for the function of HTML, such as angle brackets, and if you want them to appear in text, special syntax is required to write them
