# HTML Text, CSS Introduction, and Basic JavaScript Instructions

## **HTML Text**

Elements are used to describe structure of page (headings, subheadings, paragraphs, etc.)

Elements can also provide semantic information, or information about what is in the element itself (e.g. `<header>` is the block at the top of a page, `<main>` is the main part of a page).

### Headings

* `<h1>` through `<h6>`
  * The larger the number, the deeper the level the heading, the smaller it is

### `<p>` tags

* Identify paragraphs, blocks of text

### Other tags
 * `<b>` - bold
 * `<i>` - italic
 * `<sup>` - superscript
 * `<sub>` - subscript
 * `<br />` - line break
 * `<hr />` - horizontal rule
 * `<strong>` - shown as bold in browsers
 * `<em>` - 'emphasis', shown as italic in browsers
 * `<blockquote>` - used for longer quotes that take up to an entire paragraph.
 * `<q>` - shorter quote
 * `<abbr>` - abbreviation
 * `<>`
 * `<>`
 * `<>`
 * `<>`
 * `<>`
 * `<>`

 # Basic JavaScript Instructions

 * A script is a combination of statements, and statements are individual instructions, like steps in a recipe.

 * Scripts contain very precise instructions

 * Variables are used to store pieces of information that can be referred to later in script

 * Arrays are a type of variable that can store numerous pieces of information `[1, 2, 3]`, `[a, b, c]`

 * JavaScript is written with numbers (0-9), strings-text('hello', 'the temperature is...'), and Boolean values (true/false).

 * Expressions evaluate, with the use of operators, into a single value 
 ```javascript
 let a = 'hello';
 let b = ' world';
 console.log(a + b); // ---> 'hello world'
 ```
